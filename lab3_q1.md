# Markdown
---
The Markdown syntax is a way of **structuring** documents and providing styling without having to use **HTML** or **Cascading Style sheets**.The name is a play on the term *markup*, which is the process of preparing documents for printing through the process of editing and layout.

You can tell Github to ignore(or escape) Markdown formatting by using ``\`` before the Markdown character.
